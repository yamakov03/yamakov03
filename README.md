## Hello

I'm a 3rd year senior completing my BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UT Austin. I'll be graduating in May 2024

My concentration is SES (software engineering and systems) and am interested in full-stack development, machine learning, and data engineering roles. Thank you for visiting my GitHub!
